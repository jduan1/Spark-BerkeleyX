    "# Text Analysis and Entity Resolution \n",
    "Entity resolution is a common, yet difficult problem in data cleaning and integration. This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to apply powerful and scalable text analysis techniques and perform entity resolution across two datasets of commercial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Resolution, or \"[Record linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage)\" is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others, to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity. Our terms with the same meaning include, \"entity disambiguation/linking\", \"duplicate detection\", \"deduplication\", \"record matching\", \"(reference) reconciliation\", \"object identification\", \"data/information integration\", and \"conflation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Resolution (ER) refers to the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, databases). ER is necessary when joining datasets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), as may be the case due to differences in record shape, storage location, and/or curator style or preference. A dataset that has undergone ER may be referred to as being cross-linked."

    "## Part 1: ER as Text Similarity - Bags of Words\n",
    "A simple approach to entity resolution is to treat all records as strings and compute their similarity with a string distance function. In this part, we will build some components for performing [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) text-analysis, and then use them to compute record similarity. Bag-of-words is a conceptually simple yet powerful approach to text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to treat strings, a.k.a. **documents**, as unordered collections of words, or **tokens**, i.e., as bags of words.\n",
    "> **Note on terminology**: a \"token\" is the result of parsing the document down to the elements we consider \"atomic\" for the task at hand. Tokens can be things like words, numbers, acronyms, or other exotica like word-roots or fixed-length character strings. Bag of words techniques all apply to any sort of token, so when we say \"bag-of-words\" we really mean \"bag-of-tokens,\" strictly speaking. Tokens become the atomic unit of text comparison. If we want to compare two documents, we count how many tokens they share in common. If we want to search for documents with keyword queries (this is what Google does), then we turn the keywords into tokens and find documents that contain them. The power of this approach is that it makes string comparisons insensitive to small differences that probably do not affect meaning much, for example, punctuation and word order."

    "Now we are ready to do text comparisons in a formal way. The metric of string distance we will use is called [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space. Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors. This is much easier than it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors? The answer is familiar: bag-of-words! We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions. For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world! Goodbye, world!\" as a vector. Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them? Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a\\cdot b=|a||b|\\cos\\theta\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here $a\\cdot b=\\sum a_ib_i$ is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and $|a| = \\sqrt{ \\sum a_i^2 }$ is the norm of $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors. With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{similarity}=\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{|a||b|}=\\frac{\\sum a_ib_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2}\\sqrt{\\sum b_i^2}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive. The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction. For that case, the cosine of the angle will be large. Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small. Therefore, cosine similarity scales proportionally with our intuitive sense of similarity."
